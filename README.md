Sharing piece of job is done at Intel Delta Course 2017.
The Python programm opens stream from the webcamera, detects faces and recognizes emotions, using OpenCV library.

The "Android" file is a preparation for a further development. F.e., you may place some openCV activity in the "onCameraViewStarted" function (don't forget to install the suitable openCV manager on the device)
